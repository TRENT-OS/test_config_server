# ConfigService Test Application

## Getting Started

The main purpose of this application is to test the ConfigServer component.
It consists of several TestApps that in part have a local ConfigService lib
running and a connection to a remote ConfigService server instance.
The remote ConfigServer makes use of a connected RamDisk to write and read the
config parameters.
